In my current capacity as a CRO (Complaint Resolution Official), Ticketing Agent, Check In Agent and Baggage Agent with Delta Airlines I utilize these skills and principles on a daily basis. For example as a CRO I am the first point of contact for disgruntled passengers, particularly those with a disability.  </p>
